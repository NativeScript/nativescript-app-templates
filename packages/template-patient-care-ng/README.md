# Patient Care Template

## Quick Start
Execute the following command to create an app from this template:

```
tns create my-patient-care --template tns-template-patient-care-ng
```

> Note: This command will create a new NativeScript app that uses the latest version of this template published to [npm] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/tns-template-patient-care-ng).

If you want to create a new app that uses the source of the template from the `master` branch, you can execute the following:

```
tns create my-patient-care --template https://github.com/NativeScript/template-patient-care-ng
```

**NB:** Please, have in mind that the master branch may refer to dependencies that are not on NPM yet!
