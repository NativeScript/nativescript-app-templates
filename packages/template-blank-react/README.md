# React NativeScript Blank Template

App templates help you jump start your native cross-platform apps with built-in UI elements and best practices. Save time writing boilerplate code over and over again when you create new apps.

## Quick Start from NPM package
Execute the following command to create an app from this template:

```
ns create my-blank-react --react

cd my-blank-react
npm install

ns preview
# or
ns run android
# or
ns run ios
```

> Note: This command will create a new NativeScript app that uses the latest version of this template published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nativescript/template-blank-react).


**NB:** Please, keep in mind that the master branch may refer to dependencies that are not on NPM yet!

## Walkthrough

Having created an app from this template, here's an introduction to how it works:

### Architecture

- `src/app.ts`: The app entrypoint. It renders the MainStack component as the root component.
- `src/components/MainStack.tsx`: A React Navigation 5 [stack navigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/5.x/stack-navigator/) serving as the root component.
- `src/components/ScreenOne.tsx`, `src/components/ScreenTwo.tsx`: A couple of screens to navigate to.
- `src/NavigationParamList.tsx`: A record of the navigation params for each route in your app.

### The basics

Learn React NativeScript itself by reading [its docs](https://react-nativescript.netlify.app/docs/introduction/introduction.html).

Learn how to navigate by referring to the React Navigation 5 [docs])https://reactnavigation.org/docs/5.x/getting-started) and refer to the [react-nativescript-navigation](https://github.com/shirakaba/react-nativescript-navigation/tree/master/react-nativescript-navigation) repo to see which options are supported for each navigator.

React libraries without a dependency on `react-dom` (like Redux) should work just fine in React NativeScript as long as the `react` version is compatible.

## Get Help
The NativeScript framework has a vibrant community that can help when you run into problems.
