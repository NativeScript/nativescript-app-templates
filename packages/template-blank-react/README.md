# React NativeScript Blank Template

App templates help you jump start your native cross-platform apps with built-in UI elements and best practices. Save time writing boilerplate code over and over again when you create new apps.

## Quick Start from NPM package
Execute the following command to create an app from this template:

```
tns create my-blank-react --template tns-template-blank-react

cd my-blank-react
npm install

tns preview
# or
tns run android
# or
tns run ios
```

> Note: This command will create a new NativeScript app that uses the latest version of this template published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tns-template-blank-react).

## Quick start from the latest master

```sh
tns create my-blank-react --template https://github.com/shirakaba/tns-template-blank-react/tarball/master
```

## Building from a local clone of the repo

If you want to create a new app that uses the source of the template from the `master` branch, you can execute the following:

```
# clone nativescript-app-templates monorepo locally
git clone https://github.com/shirakaba/tns-template-blank-react.git

# create app template from local source (all templates are in the 'packages' subfolder of the monorepo)
tns create my-blank-react --template tns-template-blank-react

cd my-blank-react
npm install

tns preview
# or
tns run android
# or
tns run ios
```

**NB:** Please, keep in mind that the master branch may refer to dependencies that are not on NPM yet!

## Walkthrough

### Architecture
There is a single blank component located in:
- `/components/AppContainer.tsx` - sets up an empty page layout.

**Home** page has the following components:
- `<actionBar>` - It holds the title of the page.
- `<gridLayout>` - The main page layout that should contains all the page content.
