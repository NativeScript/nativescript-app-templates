# NativeScript with Solid Blank Template
App templates help you jump start your native cross-platform apps with built-in UI elements and best practices. Save time writing boilerplate code over and over again when you create new apps.

## Quick Start
Execute the following command to create an app from this template:

```
ns create my-blank-solid --template @nativescript/template-blank-solid-ts
```

> Note: This command will create a new NativeScript app that uses the latest version of this template published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nativescript/template-blank-solid).

If you want to create a new app that uses the source of the template from the `main` branch, you can execute the following:

```
# clone nativescript-app-templates monorepo locally
git clone git@github.com:NativeScript/nativescript-app-templates.git

# create app template from local source (all templates are in the 'packages' subfolder of the monorepo)
ns create my-blank-solid --template nativescript-app-templates/packages/template-blank-solid
```

**NB:** Please, have in mind that the main branch may refer to dependencies that are not on NPM yet!
