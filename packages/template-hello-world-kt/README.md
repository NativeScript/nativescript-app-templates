# NativeScript KotlinJS Template

This template creates a "Hello, world" NativeScript app using KotlinJS.

If you want to create a new app that uses the source of the template from the `experimental` branch, you can execute the following:

```
# clone nativescript-app-templates monorepo locally
git clone git@github.com:NativeScript/nativescript-app-templates.git
git checkout experimental

# create app template from local source (all templates are in the 'packages' subfolder of the monorepo)
tns create my-hello-world-kt --template nativescript-app-templates/packages/template-hello-world-kt
```
