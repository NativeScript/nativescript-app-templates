NOTE: This guide assumes that you have a working version of the Enterprise Login NativeScript app set up locally.

### Modify the app to use your Kinvey project

 - In Kinvey go to your app dashboard (you can find your app key and secret in the dropdown menu in the environment sidebar), copy both the **App Key** and **App Secret** then replace them in `app/shared/config.ts`. For example if your App Key is **kid_Sy8CV9v7W** with App Secret **94d5019e0f45412b9dc419f94e019ca0**, the updated config.ts will look like:
```typescript
export class Config {
    static kinveyAppKey = "kid_Sy8CV9v7W";
    static kinveyAppSecret = "94d5019e0f45412b9dc419f94e019ca0";
}
```
