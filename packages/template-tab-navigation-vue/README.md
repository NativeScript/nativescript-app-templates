## Key Features
- Tabbed navigation
- Three blank pages hooked to the bottom navigation
- Customizable theme
- UX and development best practices
- Easy to understand code through extensive code comments

## Quick Start
Execute the following command to create an app from this template:

```
tns create my-tab-vue --template tns-template-tab-navigation-vue
```

> Note: This command will create a new NativeScript app that uses the latest version of this template published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tns-template-tab-navigation-vue).

If you want to create a new app that uses the source of the template from the `master` branch, you can execute the following:

```
# clone nativescript-app-templates monorepo locally
git clone git@github.com:NativeScript/nativescript-app-templates.git

# create app template from local source (all templates are in the 'packages' subfolder of the monorepo)
tns create my-tab-vue --template nativescript-app-templates/packages/template-tab-navigation-vue
```

**NB:** Please, have in mind that the master branch may refer to dependencies that are not on NPM yet!

## Walkthrough

### Architecture
The application root component is located at:
- `/components/App.vue` - sets up the bottom navigation layout and references the navigatable pages contents.

The template has the following pages used for the tab views:
- `/components/Items.vue` - the master home page. Displays a list of items and navigates to the item details page on item tap.
- `/components/ItemDetails.vue` - the item details page. Displays the details of the tapped item.
- `/components/Browse.vue` - blank page
- `/components/Search.vue` - blank page

### Styling
This template is set up to use SASS for styling. All classes used are based on the {N} core theme â€“ consult the [documentation](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/ui/theme.html#theme) to understand how to customize it. Check it out to see what classes you can use on which component.

It has 4 global style files that are located at the root of the app folder:
- `_app-variables.scss` - holds the global SASS variables that are imported on each component's styles.
- `_app-common.scss` - the global common style sheet. These style rules are applied to both Android and iOS.
- `app.android.scss` - the global Android style sheet. These style rules are applied to Android only.
- `app.ios.scss` - the global iOS style sheet. These style rules are applied to iOS only.
