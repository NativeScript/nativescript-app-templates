# Health Survey Template
App templates help you jump start your native cross-platform apps with built-in UI elements and best practices. Save time writing boilerplate code over and over again when you create new apps.

This Health Survey template is a fundamental building block for researchers and developers to create powerful apps for medical research with visual consent flows, customizable survey modules, and HIPAA compliant cloud support from Kinvey. The template uses a RadDataForm component to display the Login/Register pages. The RadDataForm component is part of [Progress NativeScript UI](https://github.com/telerik/nativescript-ui-feedback).

## Quick Start
Execute the following command to create an app from this template:

```
tns create my-health-survey --template tns-template-health-survey-ng
```

> Note: This command will create a new NativeScript app that uses the latest version of this template published to [npm] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/tns-template-health-survey-ng).

If you want to create a new app that uses the source of the template from the `master` branch, you can execute the following:

```
tns create my-health-survey --template https://github.com/NativeScript/template-health-survey-ng
```

**NB:** Please, have in mind that the master branch may refer to dependencies that are not on NPM yet!
