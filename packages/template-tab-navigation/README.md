App templates help you jump start your native cross-platform apps with built-in UI elements and best practices. Save time writing boilerplate code over and over again when you create new apps.

App template featuring a TabView component for navigation.

## Key Features
- Tab navigation
- Five blank pages hooked to the tab navigation
- Customizable theme
- UX and development best practices
- Easy to understand code

## Quick Start
Execute the following command to create an app from this template:

```
tns create my-tab-js --template tns-template-tab-navigation
```

> Note: This command will create a new NativeScript app that uses the latest version of this template published to [npm] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/tns-template-tab-navigation).

If you want to create a new app that uses the source of the template from the `master` branch, you can execute the following:

```
# clone nativescript-app-templates monorepo locally
git clone git@github.com:NativeScript/nativescript-app-templates.git

# create app template from local source (all templates are in the 'packages' subfolder of the monorepo)
tns create my-tab-js --template nativescript-app-templates/packages/template-tab-navigation
```

**NB:** Please, have in mind that the master branch may refer to dependencies that are not on NPM yet!

## Walkthrough

### Architecture
The application root module is located at:
- `/app/app-root` - sets up the tab navigation with individual navigation frames in each content item.

The template has the following pages used for the tab content items:
- `/app/home/home-items-page` - the master home page. Displays a list of items and navigates to the item details page on item tap.
- `/app/home/home-item-detail/home-item-detail-page` - the item details page. Displays the details of the tapped item.
- `/app/browse/browse-page` - blank page
- `/app/search/search-page` - blank page

### Styling
This template is set up to use SASS for styling. All classes used are based on the {N} core theme â€“ consult the [documentation](https://github.com/NativeScript/theme) to understand how to customize it.

It has 3 global style files that are located at the root of the app folder:

- `/app/_app-common.scss` - the global common style sheet. These style rules are applied to both Android and iOS.
- `/app/app.android.scss` - the global Android style sheet. These style rules are applied to Android only.
- `/app/app.ios.scss` - the global iOS style sheet. These style rules are applied to iOS only.
